def is_abundant_number(n):
    '''
    A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n
    and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

    By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.

# As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16,
# the smallest number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24
